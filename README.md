# SimuBayes

SimuBayes is a powerful, user-friendly machine learning software designed to streamline complex data analysis tasks, from preprocessing to advanced statistical modeling. Built for researchers, engineers, and data scientists, SimuBayes provides an integrated workflow for data cleaning, Deep Gaussian Process (DeepGP) modeling, prediction, forward uncertainty quantification (UQ), and sensitivity analysis.

## Key Features

âœ” Smart Data Cleaning â€“ Prepare and preprocess datasets efficiently for robust modeling.

âœ” Deep Gaussian Process (DeepGP) Modeling â€“ Capture complex, high-dimensional relationships with Bayesian non-parametric models.

âœ” Accurate Predictions with Uncertainty Bounds â€“ Generate reliable forecasts with quantified confidence intervals.

âœ” Forward Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) â€“ Assess and propagate uncertainties in model outputs for risk-aware decision-making.

âœ” Sensitivity Analysis â€“ Identify critical parameters using Morris screening (for screening) and Sobol indices (for global sensitivity).

## Why Choose SimuBayes?

Unlike conventional machine learning tools, SimuBayes combines flexibility, statistical rigor, and computational efficiency in a single platform:

ðŸ”¹ Seamless Workflow â€“ From raw data to actionable insights, SimuBayes eliminates the need for multiple disjointed tools.

ðŸ”¹ Bayesian Robustness â€“ DeepGP models provide uncertainty-aware predictions, crucial for high-stakes applications.

ðŸ”¹ Interpretable Sensitivity Analysis â€“ Go beyond black-box modelsâ€”understand which inputs drive outputs the most.

ðŸ”¹ User-Friendly & Scalable â€“ Designed for both experts and practitioners, with optimized performance for large datasets.

Whether you're optimizing engineering designs, analyzing scientific data, or improving predictive models, SimuBayes empowers data-driven decisions with transparency, reliability, and efficiency.
